##  Problem Statement

Traditional campus systems rely heavily on manual processes and fragmented software, leading to inefficiency, inaccuracies, poor analytics, and limited insight into student performance and placement readiness. There is a lack of a unified, intelligent platform that automates attendance, academics, assessments, interviews, coding evaluations, payments, and analytics. NeuroCampus addresses this gap by providing a single AI-driven campus operating system that automates end-to-end campus operations with high accuracy, scalability, and intelligence.
